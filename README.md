Starling deferred renderer sample project
=========================================

This is a sample project that uses my deferred renderer for Starling. Needs [this fork of Starling](https://github.com/Varnius/Starling-Framework) in order to work. Also requires both Flash Player 11.6 beta player and corresponding playerglobal.swc as MRTs and some other features are currently supported only by 11.6 beta release of the runtime.

Deferred renderer currently supports:

* Deferred point lights (done, but may need improvements)

TODOs:

* Ambient and cone lights.
* Dynamic 2D shadows.
