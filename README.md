Starling deferred renderer demo
=========================================

This is a sample project that uses my deferred renderer for Starling. Currently needs [this fork of Starling](https://github.com/Varnius/Starling-Framework) and [Starling Renderer Plus](https://github.com/Varnius/StarlingRendererPlus) library in order to work. Also requires Flash Player/AIR 14+. You can find more info about included features [here](https://github.com/Varnius/StarlingRendererPlus).

Also note that it is possible that slower integrated GPU may be picked automatically for rendering the demo on systems with APU + separate GPU combination, therefore performance may suffer.
