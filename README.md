Starling deferred renderer demo
=========================================

This is a sample project that uses my deferred renderer for Starling. Needs [this fork of Starling](https://github.com/Varnius/Starling-Framework) in order to work. Also requires Flash Player/AIR 14+.

<a href="http://nekobit.eu/demos/starling-deferred/Sandbox.html" target="_blank">Online Demo</a> (currently not working with Chrome PPAPI plugin, try it using ActiveX or NPAPI ones)

Deferred renderer currently supports:

* Deferred point lights.
* Dynamic pixel perfect 2D shadows.

TODOs:

* Spotlights.

Deferred renderer is partially based on blog posts [here](http://www.catalinzima.com/xna/tutorials/deferred-rendering-in-xna/) and [here](http://www.soolstyle.com/2010/06/29/2d-lightning-continued/).
